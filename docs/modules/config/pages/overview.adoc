This is version *{page-component-version}* of Module One in Component B. Welcome to the SAp Workshop.

There is no additional configuration required for standard BAPI integration other than ensuring the SAP user configured within the SAP Connector has sufficient roles/privileges for accessing and invoking the desired BAPIs.

If the standard functions do not meet your integration requirements, you will need to enlist an SAP ABAP developer to design and implement a custom function according to your needs. Function design is beyond the scope of this guide but remember to activate the BAPI function for it to be visible to the SAP Connector when it refreshes the metadata for DataSense.

== SAP Configuration for IDOC Integration

Before proceeding with the SAP Connector guide, there are some configurations that need to be setup on your SAP instance for IDOC Integration. These configurations allow MuleSoft to register and act as a partner system. The external application then runs in a server mode, waiting for messages from the SAP system.

Please use this guide as a reference. Your SAP instance may be configured differently and have restrictions that prevent you from completing the guide fully. If you run into issues on the SAP side, please contact your SAP Administrator.

== Overview

*Reminder*: This guide requires the use of your own SAP instance. If you don’t have one, you can leverage a hosted SAP service. For the purposes of this guide, we utilized Sandbox SAP.

== 1. Create a RFC Destination - SM59

The first step is to create a RFC destination. The RFC destination is a symbolic name that is used to direct events to a target system masking the Program ID. The target system in this case is the MuleSoft SAP Connector which acts as an inbound endpoint to receive IDocs and Functions over RFC. The Program ID is configured in both the SAP GUI and the SAP Connector.

1.1

1.1 Enter in SAP transaction code *SM59*

1.2
image:RFC1.2.png[]

1. Expand the *TCP/IP connections* node

2. Click on the *New* icon.

1.3
image:RFC1.3.png[]

1. Enter a name in the *RFC Destination* field.

e.g. MULE_LAB

For the *Connection Type* field, enter a *T*

2. Click on the *Save* icon

1.4
image:RFC1.4.png[]

1. Under the *Activation Type* section, check the *Registered Server Program* radio button.

2. Under the *Registered Server Program* section, enter a program ID in the *Program ID* field.

e.g. MULE_LAB

3. Click on *Save*

1.5
image:RFC1.5.png[]

Click on the yellow circle to exit and return to the SAP Easy Access screen.

== 2. Create Port for IDoc Processing - WE21

The next step is to create a port for IDoc processing. A port identifies where to send messages and will be linked to the RFC destination that you created in the previous step (e.g. MULE_LAB)

2.1
image:RFC2.1.png[]

Enter in SAP transaction code *WE21*

2.2
image:RFC2.2.png[]

1. Expand the *Transactional RFC* node.

2. Click on the *New* icon.

2.3
image:RFC2.3.png[]

Leave the *Generate port name* radio button selected and click on the *Green* check mark button.

2.4
image:RFC2.4.png[]

1. Fill in the *Description* field

2. Enter the *RFC destination* that was created in Step 2

e.g. MULE_LAB

3. Click on the *Save* button at the top.

4. Remember the port name that was created. You’ll need this later in the setup.

e.g. A000000054

2.5
image:RFC2.5.png[]

Click on the yellow circle to exit and return to the SAP Easy Access screen.

== 3. Use or Create Two Logical Systems - SALE

Logical Systems are the unique IDs that represent participating systems in a distributed environment. For these labs, you will need two Logical Systems. One of which corresponds to the SAP System and the other to the MuleSoft SAP Connector.

Your instance should already have a Logical System setup for SAP and assigned to the client. You will have to either create a new Logical System for Mule, or leverage an existing one in the system. This will represent the MuleSoft SAP Connector to either function as an inbound or outbound endpoint.

3.1
image:RFC3.1.png[]

Enter in SAP transaction code *SALE*

3.2
image:RFC3.2.png[]

Expand *Basic Settings > Logical Systems*

Click on the icon next to *Assign Logical System to Client*

3.3
image:RFC3.3.png[]

If the *Information* window pops up, click on the *Green* check mark button to proceed.

3.4
image:RFC3.4.png[]

Find your Client ID number in the list and click on the Details icon.

e.g. 800

3.5
image:RFC3.5.png[]

Find your Client ID number in the list and click on the Details icon.

e.g. 800

3.6
image:RFC3.6.png[]

Take note of the *Logical system* field.

e.g. T90CLNT090

3.7
image:RFC3.7.png[]

Click on the yellow circle to exit and go back up a level.

3.8
image:RFC3.8.png[]

In the *Display IMG* screen, click on the icon next to *Define Logical System*


If the *Information* window pops up, click on the *Green* check mark button to proceed.

3.9
image:RFC3.9.png[]

If you have permission to create new Logical System, click on *New Entries*.

3.10
image:RFC3.10.png[]
Otherwise, take note of a Logical System from the list.

e.g. APOCLNT810

3.11
image:RFC3.11.png[]
Click on the yellow circle to exit and return to the SAP Easy Access screen.

== 4. Use or Create a Partner Profile - WE20

Partner profiles are a prerequisite for data exchange. This involves defining who can exchange messages with the SAP system and using which port.

The partner profiles you use (or create) are tied to the Logical Systems from the previous step. Generally, the Logical System for the client should already exist.

4.1
image:RFC4.1.png[]

Enter in SAP transaction code *WE20*

4.2
image:RFC4.2.png[]

1. Expand the *Partner Type LS* node.

2. If you created a new Logical System in *Step 4*, click on *Create*. Otherwise, look to see if the Logical System Partner Profile already exists. It will have the same name as the Logical System.

e.g. T90CLNT090

If the Partner Profile doesn’t exist, click on *Create*.

3. In the *Partner No.* field, enter in the Logical System name of either the one you created or of one that already exists in the system.

e.g. APOCLNT810

4. Click on *Save*

4.3
image:RFC4.3.png[]

In the Partner Profile, click on *Create inbound parameter* in the Inbound parmtrs. section.

For the purposes of this guide, you'll just be adding one message type (DEBMAS) but you can add as many here as needed.

4.4
image:RFC4.4.png[]

1. In the Message type field, enter the following:

*DEBMAS*

2. In the Process code field under the Inbound options tab, enter the following:

*DEBM*

3. Click on *Save*

4. Click on *Back*

4.5
image:RFC4.5.png[]

Back on the Partner Profiles screen, click on *Create outbound parameter* under the *Outbound parmtrs.* section.

For the purposes of this guide, you'll just be adding one message type (DEBMAS) but you can add as many here as needed.

4.6
image:RFC4.6.png[]

In the *Message Type* field, enter the following:

*DEBMAS*

4.7
image:RFC4.7.png[]

In the *Outbound Options* tab, click on the *Receiver port* field.

You can either type in the *Port* you created in *Step 3* or click on the icon to the right of the field.

4.8
image:RFC4.8.png[]

If you clicked to search for the port, you’ll be presented with the *Receiver port* screen.

Find and select the port and click on the *Green* check mark.

4.9
image:RFC4.9.png[]

1. Under the *Output Mode* section, select the *Transfer IDoc Immed.* radio button.

2. Under the IDoc Type section, enter the following in the *Basic type* field:

*DEBMAS03*

4.10

Click on *Save*

4.11
image:RFC4.11.png[]
Click on the yellow circle to exit to the *Partner profiles* screen and then click it again to return to the SAP Easy Access screen.

== 5. Create a Distribution Model - BD64

A distribution model is used to describe the ALE message flow between logical systems. In the case of this workshop, the SAP Client and the MuleSoft SAP Connector. Business objects are distributed to connected recipients according to a unique distribution model that can contain rules of varying complexity depending on the type of business objects involved.

5.1
image:RFC5.1.png[]

Enter in SAP transaction code *BD64*

5.2
image:RFC5.2.png[]

Click on the *Switch between display and edit* mode icon.

5.3

5.6
image:RFC5.6.png[]

Click on *Add message type*

For the purposes of this guide, you'll just be adding one message type (DEBMAS). If more are required, you would repeat this step.

5.7
image:RFC5.7.png[]

In the *Add Message Type* window, enter data in the following fields:

*Sender : <Partner profile from Step 4.5>*

*e.g. T90CLNT090*

*Receiver : <Partner profile from Step 4.9>*

*e.g. APOCLNT810*

*Message Type : DEBMAS*

5.8
image:RFC5.8.png[]

The model view should look like the following screen.

5.9
image:RFC5.9.png[]

Click on *Save*

5.10
image:RFC5.10.png[]

Click on the yellow circle to exit and return to the SAP Easy Access screen.

== Summary

These setup steps are provided as a general guideline and can vary from system to system depending on your user permissions and pre-existing configurations that may already be applied. Once configured, you can walk through the IDOC integration guide here. It will show you how to setup the SAP Connector to act as an inbound endpoint.
